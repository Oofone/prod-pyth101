# prod-pyth101
Seminar series; writing good python that is production ready. Covering topics like OOPs, Unit-tests, Logging, and Dependency Injection.

The notebook Python Brush Up and OOPs serves as a quick run-through to just quickly go through a very small python module and understand how to structure your code and make it readable and easy to understand and collaborate with. 

We'll breakdown the following things after that individually:

* Logging
* Data Validation
* Metaclasses and Abstract Classes
* Enforcing Stricter Typing (when necessary)
* Unit-tests

After that, we'll **integrate a Toy Application** with Flask to make a simple Server. This will allow you to make your application accessible accross the web.

Finally we'll cover the last two topics: 

1. Dependency Injection (Multiple Encryption implementations)
2. Creating a pipeline with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) for CI/CD to get your code from your laptop to a production host where it can be accessed by people around the world. What is CI/CD? You can get a good run-through here: [Explaination by Circle CI](https://circleci.com/). 

As part of creating a CI or Continuous Integration work-flow we'll be covering topics such as Integration Tests and Feedback notifications as well. 

Hope this turns out to be somewhat informative!
